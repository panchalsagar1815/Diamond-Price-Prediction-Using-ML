# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Using-ML



The "Diamond Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project is an innovative endeavour that leverages advanced data analysis techniques to forecast diamond prices based on various intrinsic characteristics. The features considered in this analysis include carat weight, cut quality, colour grade, clarity, depth percentage, table percentage, and geometric dimensions (x, y, z).

This project seeks to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate diamond prices, providing valuable insights for both consumers and the diamond industry. By training the machine learning model on a dataset comprising diverse diamonds with known prices, the aim is to uncover patterns and relationships among the specified features, allowing for the creation of a reliable price prediction tool.
